## Keep üêõüêúüêû out of your app

Bugs can be [really cool](https://www.cbc.ca/kidscbc2/the-feed/14-of-the-worlds-weirdest-insects), but not when it comes to your app.

That's where `sentry-expo` comes in! Keep a close eye on your app, whether it's in development, staging, or production, by getting real-time insight into errors and bugs. That way, you can quickly reproduce, fix, and re-deploy!

## ü§î How do I use this?

<details>
<summary>Hey- before you actually use Sentry, make sure you've created a Sentry project. How do you do that? Open this drop-down to find out!</summary>
<br>
üö® Creating a Sentry project

Before getting real-time updates on errors and making your app generally incredible, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. [Sign up for Sentry](https://sentry.io/signup/) (it's free), and create a project in your Dashboard. Take note of your organization name, and project name.
2. Take note of your `DSN`, you'll need it later
3. Go to the [Sentry API section](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/), and create an auth token (Ensure you have `project:write` selected under scopes). Save this, too.

Once you have each of these: organization name, project name, DSN, and auth token, you're all set!

</details>

### Step 1

In your project directory, run

```sh
expo install sentry-expo
```

> If you don't have `expo-cli` installed, [you should](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/)! But you can also just install with `yarn add sentry-expo`.

### Step 2

Add the following to your app's main file (usually `App.js`):

```js
import * as Sentry from 'sentry-expo';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR DSN HERE',
  enableInExpoDevelopment: true,
  debug: true,
});
```

### Step 3

Add the `expo.hooks` object to your project's `app.json` (or `app.config`) file:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    // ... your existing configuration
    "hooks": {
      "postPublish": [
        {
          "file": "sentry-expo/upload-sourcemaps",
          "config": {
            "organization": "your sentry organization's short name here",
            "project": "your sentry project's name here",
            "authToken": "your auth token here"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> If you're using the bare workflow, or using a plain React Native app, you should also follow [these quick steps](#bare-workflow-setup) to finish up your setup

All done! For more information on customization and additional features, read the full guide on using Sentry in Expo apps in our docs ‚û°Ô∏è ["Using
Sentry"](https://docs.expo.io/guides/using-sentry/).

### Bare workflow setup

Setting up `sentry-expo` in the bare workflow requires just a few extra steps in addition to those listed above:

1. Run `yarn sentry-wizard -i reactNative -p ios android`. This will automatically configure your native Android & iOS projects
2. The previous step will add an extra

   ```
   import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

   Sentry.init({
     dsn: 'YOUR DSN',
   });
   ```

to your root project file (usually `App.js`), so make sure you remove it (but keep the `sentry-expo` import and original `Sentry.init` call!)

If you don't rely on `expo-updates`, you're all done! If you do, read on...

With `expo-updates`, release builds of both iOS and Android apps will create and embed a new update from your JavaScript source at build-time. This new update will not be published automatically and will exist only in the binary with which it was bundled. Since it isn't published, the sourcemaps aren't uploaded in the usual way like they are when you run `expo publish` (actually, we are relying on Sentry's native scripts to handle that). Because of this you have some extra things to add:

- Set your `release` in `Sentry.init()` to Sentry's expected value- `${bundleIdentifier}@${version}+${buildNumber}` (iOS) or `${androidPackage}@${version}+${versionCode}` (Android).
- Set your `dist` in Sentry.init()` to Sentry's expected value: your buildNumber (iOS) or versionCode (Android).

Skipping or misconfiguring either of these will result in sourcemaps not working, and thus you won't see proper stacktraces in your errors.
