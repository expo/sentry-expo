# Changelog

## Unpublished

### 🛠 Breaking changes

- Exports from `@sentry/react-native` or `@sentry/browser` are now namespaced.

  ```js
  import { Native, Browser } from 'sentry-expo';

  const { ReactNativeClient } = Native;
  const { Transports } = Browser;
  ```

- `upload-sourcemaps.js` is now exported from `'sentry-expo/dist/upload-sourcemaps'`

### 🎉 New features

- Expo Web support: no changes needed!

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- You can now pass a function to the `integrations` option for `init()` which will receive all the default Sentry and sentry-expo integrations, here's an example on how to use it:

  ```js
  Sentry.init(
    ...
    integrations: (integrations) => {
      let filteredIntegrations = integrations.filter(
        (i) => i.name !== "SomeIntegrationNameYouDontWant"
      );
      return filteredIntegrations;
    }
  )
  ```
